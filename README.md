# 3D (2.5D) Sector based 3D Engine!

The continuation of the old ASCII-based raycaster engine (with perspective-correct looking up and down!). This is turning into a Build-style engine!

This new engine uses sector-based rendering which allows such cool features such as:

- Any angle walls
- Different height sectors
- Windows
- Platforms
- Voxel-objects (again, think Build Engine)
- NES-color pallet (and probably more in the future!)
- All while retaining the ascii-based renderer :)

And so much more! The limits are endless!


## Current TODO: list:

- ‚úÖ Floor texture:
  - ‚úÖ Fix Looking up and down
  - ‚úÖ Fix sector height change
- Re-implement Sprite rendering (now working officially via intersection method)
  - ‚úÖ Make sure sprites properly face the player (with perspective correction)
  - ‚úÖ Perhaps draw the sprite up-down by default, and the rotate the same direction as the player?
  - re-implement angles and animation
  - re-implement moving
  - ‚úÖ re-implement sorting 
  - ‚úÖ re-implement transparency
  - ‚úÖ refactor checkPlayerInSector function to also work for sprites
- ‚úÖ Fix Ceiling texture rendering
  - ‚úÖ Re-implmement and refactor skybox
- Think about slopes. I kinda don't want to open that can of worms, but maybe think about slopes...

- ‚úÖ Refactor checkSectors function
- Rethink variable scope of some variables
- Fisheye correction is still a bit wonky
- Wall-collision detection... it's bad
- ‚úÖ Build in Texture X and Y offset

#### üë©üèº‚Äçüíª Level Editor (TODO:)
**OH MY GOD THIS WAS SO MUCH WORK**
- ‚úÖ Refactor level file: No more sectorMeta, no more nested arrays for walls, single source of truth for all level data 

##### More Level Editor Things
- üë©üèº‚Äçüíª live-preview... this should be possible, just load the engine code in the editor. 
  - After some testing it looks like setting up a server and write to file. Actually this might be cleaner...
- ‚ùì Build in sector texture scale

## Lighting Idea

First iteration will be baked lighting
- Cast n (8?) rays radially from the light source. 
- Check if they are colliding with any wall in any sector 
  - (later: only the sectors the light source is in plus the ones connected to it)
- New array:  oLightMap Store position where it collided, and how far from the wall it is
- When rendering each column, check the world position where the wall was hit, then look up the nearest light info in the oLightMap array, and shade that pixel accordingly
  - Probably by passing it to the get Sample Pixel function 



All of the below is outdated, I'll write up some docs sometime.

Here is the current TODO:
- ‚úÖ Level Editor panning (maybe zooming, probably not though (Edit: no zooming))
- ‚úÖ Build in Texture X and Y offset




OLD!!!!!
- Grid (with 0.125 grid size?)
- User interaction as follows:
  1. levels consist of sectors
  2. clicking a sector will enable a right-side context menu where to edit *floor height+tex, ceiling height+tex,*
  3. sectors consist of walls (maybe with normals?)
    - clicking a sector ALSO will make points movable
  4. Walls are drawn as continuous polygons: 
    - i.e. click, make points, points automatically connect. 
    - level editor parses out each two lines into individual walls
    - left-clicking a wall will show a context menu where to set the *portal, walltex, textXsample, texYsample*
    - right-clicking a wall will add another point to the polygon
  5. Sprite mode. In this mode,
     -  click anywhere to place a sprite
     -  left-clicking a sprite brings up context menu where to set sprite texture, velocity, and just about anything else we can image
-
